a test setup, use npm start to make this work from dist. should auto-everything IF you use a psc-ide client (e.g. an editor extension/plugin). otherwise run pulp -w build in another tab.

this probably doesn't work. if you actually know how extensions are supposed to work, this should be pretty easy to fix up for your own uses. otherwise, i have no idea.
